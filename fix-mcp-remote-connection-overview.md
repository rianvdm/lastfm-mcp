# Fix MCP Remote Connection Branch Overview

## Branch: `fix-mcp-remote-connection`

### Problem Statement
The Cloudflare AI playground (https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/) was unable to connect to the Last.fm MCP server. The connection would hang at "Connecting client via SSE..." and never complete the initialization handshake.

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. SSE Endpoint Event Format
**Problem**: The SSE endpoint was sending JSON-encoded data `"/sse"` which clients were URL-encoding to `%22/sse%22`
**Fix**: Changed to send plain text format: `event: endpoint\ndata: /sse`
**Commit**: `9019a92`

#### 2. SSE Timeout Issues
**Problem**: SSE connections were causing Worker timeouts due to immediate writes to the TransformStream
**Fix**: Deferred initial endpoint event write using `Promise.resolve()` and added proper headers
**Commit**: `cf8e7a7`

#### 3. Cross-Request I/O Errors
**Problem**: Attempting to write to SSE streams from different request contexts (Cloudflare Workers limitation)
**Error**: "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request"
**Fix**: Implemented correct MCP pattern - POST requests return HTTP responses directly, SSE only for server-initiated messages
**Commit**: `a32f884`, `4b8992f`

### Current Status

#### ✅ What Works
- SSE endpoint correctly sends `event: endpoint, data: /sse`
- POST requests to `/sse` return proper JSON-RPC responses
- No more Worker timeouts or cross-request I/O errors
- CORS headers are properly configured
- Server fully implements MCP Streamable HTTP transport pattern
- Verified working with direct browser testing

#### ❌ What Doesn't Work
- Cloudflare AI playground still cannot connect
- Playground client never makes GET /sse request (only POST requests appear in logs)
- Playground uses newer protocol version (2025-06-18 vs our 2024-11-05)

### Technical Details

#### Correct MCP SSE Transport Pattern
```
1. GET /sse → Establishes SSE connection, receives endpoint event
2. POST /sse → Sends JSON-RPC requests, receives HTTP JSON responses
3. SSE connection → Only for server-initiated notifications/keepalives
```

#### Test Results
Browser test confirms server works correctly:
```
SSE: event: endpoint, data: /sse
POST: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{...}}
```

### Next Steps

1. **Investigation Needed**
   - Why doesn't the Cloudflare playground make GET /sse requests?
   - Does the playground have specific requirements not documented?
   - Is the protocol version mismatch (2025-06-18) causing issues?

2. **Potential Solutions**
   - Contact Cloudflare support about playground MCP implementation
   - Try implementing protocol version 2025-06-18 support
   - Test with other MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) to confirm server works

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Investigate if playground expects different endpoint URLs
   - Check if there's a specific transport mode the playground requires
   - Look for playground-specific MCP server examples

### Testing

To test the current implementation:

1. **Local SSE test**:
   ```bash
   curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8787/sse
   ```

2. **Browser test page**: Created at `/tmp/test-mcp-sse.html`

3. **Production endpoint**: `https://lastfm-mcp.rian-db8.workers.dev/sse`

### Conclusion

The Last.fm MCP server implementation appears to be correct and follows the MCP specification. The issue seems to be with the Cloudflare AI playground's client implementation, which doesn't properly establish SSE connections. The server works correctly with standard browser SSE and returns proper JSON-RPC responses.
